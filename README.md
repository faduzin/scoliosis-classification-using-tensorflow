## üìä Dataset Explanation

The dataset used in this project contains patient information relevant to scoliosis classification. It includes a variety of demographic, physical, and biomechanical attributes, along with a scoliosis degree measurement. The primary goal is to classify whether a patient has scoliosis based on their recorded scoliosis degree.

### üèó Dataset Structure  
The dataset consists of multiple columns, each representing a different attribute of the patients. The key columns are:

- **Id**: Unique identifier for each patient.  
- **Name**: Anonymized identifier for individuals.  
- **Age**: Age of the patient (in years).  
- **Mass**: Body mass of the patient (in kilograms).  
- **Height**: Height of the patient (in meters).  
- **Female / Male**: Binary columns indicating gender.  
- **Handedness (R_Handed / L_Handed)**: Indicates whether the individual is right-handed or left-handed.  
- **CoP_ML**: Center of pressure measurement in the medial-lateral direction.  
- **Scolio**: The scoliosis degree of the patient, which is the primary feature for classification.  
- **Scolio_Class**: A derived binary classification label based on the scoliosis degree:
  - üü¢ **0 (No Scoliosis)** ‚Äì If scoliosis degree is **‚â§10**  
  - üî¥ **1 (Scoliosis Present)** ‚Äì If scoliosis degree is **>10**  

### ü¶∂ Biomechanical Features (Baropodometer Readings)  
The dataset contains **biomechanical features** recorded from a **baropodometer**, a device used to analyze foot pressure distribution. These features are represented by columns **s0 to s119**, where:

- **s0 to s59**: Correspond to the **left foot sensors**.  
- **s60 to s119**: Correspond to the **right foot sensors**.  
- Each value represents the **mean pressure recorded** over the duration of the measurement.

Each sample was recorded **while the patient stood on the baropodometer for 30 to 60 seconds**, first with their **eyes closed**, and then with their **eyes open**. These readings help assess postural stability and weight distribution, which may be indicative of scoliosis-related imbalances.

### üéØ Target Variable for Classification  
The target variable for the classification model is **Scolio_Class**, which determines if a patient is classified as having scoliosis or not. This binary classification allows the use of various machine learning models to predict scoliosis based on patient characteristics.

### üîß Dataset Preprocessing Steps
- **Data Cleaning**: Formatting numerical values (e.g., converting commas to decimal points).
- **Handling Missing Values**: Ensuring there are no null or incorrect values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating the binary classification column (**Scolio_Class**) from the scoliosis degree.

# üîç Step-by-Step Guide to Finding the Best TensorFlow Model for Scoliosis Classification

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
### ‚úÖ Preprocessing
- Ensure all numerical values are correctly formatted.
- Normalize or standardize relevant numerical features.
- Convert categorical features (e.g., gender, handedness) into numerical format.

### ‚úÖ Balanced Train/Test Split
- Use **stratified sampling** to maintain class balance in both training and testing datasets.
- This ensures both classes (**Scoliosis Present and No Scoliosis**) are equally represented in both sets.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Splitting (Balanced Train/Test Split)
- Since the dataset may have an **imbalanced class distribution**, stratified sampling ensures equal representation of each class in both **training** and **test** sets.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection (Experiments with TensorFlow Parameters)
To find the best model, experiment with different parameters.

### ‚úÖ Model Type (Architecture)
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** ‚Äì Suitable for tabular data.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** ‚Äì Useful if spatial patterns exist in baropodometer readings.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs/LSTMs)** ‚Äì If analyzing time-based sequences.

### ‚úÖ Hyperparameters to Tune
1. **Number of Layers & Neurons per Layer**  
   - More layers increase model complexity but may lead to overfitting.
   - Experiment with different layer depths and neuron counts.

2. **Activation Functions**
   - **ReLU** ‚Äì Best for hidden layers.
   - **Sigmoid** ‚Äì Used in the last layer for binary classification.
   - **LeakyReLU** ‚Äì Helps avoid dead neurons.

3. **Optimizer Selection**
   - **Adam** ‚Äì Works well in most cases.
   - **SGD** ‚Äì Useful for larger datasets.
   - **RMSprop** ‚Äì Helps with recurrent patterns.

4. **Loss Function**
   - **Binary Crossentropy** ‚Äì Used for binary classification.
   - **Focal Loss** ‚Äì Useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

5. **Batch Size**
   - Larger batch sizes improve training speed but may affect generalization.
   - Common choices: **32, 64, 128**.

6. **Learning Rate**
   - Experiment with values like **0.001, 0.0001, or 0.01**.
   - Learning rate scheduling can **gradually reduce the learning rate** over epochs.

7. **Dropout Rate (Prevent Overfitting)**
   - Dropout layers help prevent overfitting by randomly disabling neurons.
   - Typical values range from **0.2 to 0.5**.

8. **Epochs**
   - Typically **50 to 200 epochs**.
   - Use **Early Stopping** to halt training if validation loss stops improving.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation & Optimization
### ‚úÖ Metrics to Monitor:
- **Accuracy** ‚Äì Measures overall correctness.
- **Precision & Recall** ‚Äì Helps balance false positives and false negatives.
- **F1-Score** ‚Äì A balance between precision and recall.
- **AUC-ROC Curve** ‚Äì Evaluates the model‚Äôs classification performance.

### ‚úÖ Ways to Improve Model Performance:
- Try **different feature selection methods** to remove unnecessary features.
- Experiment with **deeper networks or different architectures**.
- Adjust **batch size, learning rate, and dropout rate**.
- Try **different optimizers and activation functions**.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Manual experimentation** can be slow; **automated tuning** speeds up the process.
- Hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting:
  - Number of layers and neurons.
  - Learning rate.
  - Dropout rate.
  - Batch size.
  - Optimizer selection.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Finalizing the Best Model
- Once the best model is found, **train it on the full training set**.
- Save the trained model for deployment and future use.
- Use the saved model to make predictions.
